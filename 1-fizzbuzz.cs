        Challenge: Fill in the method below that prints the numbers from 1 to the limit being passed into the method. For multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

        Helpful Hints: Instead of console.log(), use Console.WriteLine() to "print" each number. Consider implementing this in a separate .NET app and then just paste the working code here.
