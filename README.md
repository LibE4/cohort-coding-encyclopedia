# Cohort Coding Encyclopedia and Weekly Challenge

### How it works:

This is a repository for everyone. At the end of the cohort, you should have a set of really great study materials for technical interviews.

There will be a weekly challenge that will test your critical thinking and C#/.NET skills. A new coding challenge will be pushed into the repo every week, and all students will make pull requests with the code that completes the challenge. Challenge responses have to be submitted by 5:00 pm on Friday to qualify. At the end of class on Saturday we'll answer and explain the solution to the challenge and accept the pull request of the student response that best answers the challenge.
